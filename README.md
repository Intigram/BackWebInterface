# Backend of the Intigram Web Interface

This is the Flask API for the Intigram web app. In order to quickly run it locally, simply run the following commands:

<pre>
cd BackWebInterface
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

Naturally, remember to subsitute the <code>pip3</code> above for just <code>pip</code> if that's you have.
